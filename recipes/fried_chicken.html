       crispiest chicken every time.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Butter Milk</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions/Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Take your cut up chicken pieces and skin them if you prefer.</li>
        <li>Put the flour in a large plastic bag (let the amount of chicken you are cooking dictate the amount of flour you use). Season the flour with paprika,<br>
             salt and pepper to taste (paprika helps to brown the chicken).</li>
        <li>
            Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk then, a few at a time, put them in the bag with the flour, seal the bag and shake to coat well.
        </li>
        <li>Place the coated chicken on a cookie sheet or tray, and cover with a clean dish towel or waxed paper.<strong> LET SIT UNTIL THE FLOUR IS OF A PASTE-LIKE CONSISTENCY.<br> THIS IS CRUCIAL!</strong>
        </li>
        <li>Fill a large skillet (cast iron is best) about 1/3 to 1/2 full with vegetable oil. Heat until <strong>VERY</strong> hot.</li>
        <li>Put in as many chicken pieces as the skillet can hold. Brown the chicken in <strong>HOT</strong> oil on both sides.</li>
        <li>
            When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let cook for 30 minutes (the chicken will be cooked through but not crispy). Remove cover, raise heat again,<br> and continue to fry until crispy.</li>
        <li>Drain the fried chicken on paper towels. Depending on how much chicken you have, you may have to fry in a few shifts. Keep the finished chicken in a <br>slightly warm oven while preparing the rest.
        </li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
